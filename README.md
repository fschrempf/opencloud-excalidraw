# Excalidraw for OpenCloud

An [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) drawing application integrated as a native [OpenCloud](https://opencloud.eu/) web extension. Create, edit and collaborate on `.excalidraw` drawings directly within OpenCloud.

## Features

- Create new Excalidraw drawings from the "New" menu
- Open and edit existing `.excalidraw` files
- Auto-save support via OpenCloud's AppWrapperRoute
- Read-only mode for shared files
- Export drawings to various formats

## Installation

1. Download the latest release archive from the [Releases](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/web-app-excalidraw/releases) page.
2. Extract the archive into your OpenCloud web assets directory:
   ```bash
   unzip web-app-excalidraw.zip -d /var/lib/opencloud/web/assets/apps/excalidraw/
   ```
3. Restart OpenCloud to pick up the new extension.

### Content Security Policy

Excalidraw loads fonts from `esm.sh` at runtime. You need to add `https://esm.sh/` to the `font-src` CSP directive in your OpenCloud configuration:

```yaml
# csp.yaml
directives:
  font-src:
    - "'self'"
    - "https://esm.sh/"
```

Without this, fonts will be blocked and Excalidraw will fall back to system fonts.
